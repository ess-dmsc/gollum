- Create fake data
- Fix the timestamp
- Rotation transformation
- What about the calibration data?
- Does the positioning of the cameras matter?
- How should the markers be placed & does the size of the markers matter?
- What does "is_recording" mean?
- How to stop: 1. when ctrl-c, how to get back to the command line; 2. when we're happy with all the rigid body info?
- If rigid body is tracking invalid then record that in kafka
   - When first rigid body message received send al00 to kafka
   - When validity changes, send relevant al00 message (OK for valid & MAJOR for invalid)
   - Then every 10 secs resend the last update including the original timestamp
